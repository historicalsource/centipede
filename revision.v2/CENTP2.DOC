		SCORING
		-------

1)Destroying a mushroom = 1
2)Partial mushrooms or "poisoned" mushrooms (after your death) = 5
3)Centipede body = 10
4)Centipede head = 100
5)Flea = 200
6)Scorpion = 1000
7)Spider = 300, 600 or 900

	When a bonus level is reached a new life is given provided the player
does not already have six.  When a new life is given a bonus life sound will be
given to alert the player.  If the player has six lives then no sound will be
given and the next bonus level will be activated.


		ATTRACT MODE
		------------

	During attract the high score table will be displayed showing eight high
scores and the player's three initials.  In the upper left corner is
player 1's score.  In the upper right corner is player 2's score.  In the middle
of the top row is the current high score.  At the bottom of the screen is the
copyright message which reads "C 1980 ATARI".  In the middle of the screen will
appear the game cost message (1 COIN 1 PLAY, etc.).  If free play was selected
then no message will appear.  There will also be a message showing the number of
points needed for a bonus life ("BONUS EVERY 10000", etc.).  If any credits have
been entered, the number of credits will be shown by a message of the form
"CREDITS 2 1/2".  Note that 1/2 credit can occur when "2 COINS 1 PLAY" is selected
and an odd number of coins has been entered.  If "2 CREDIT MINIMUM" has been
selected and there are fewer than two credits, that message will flash on and off.

	Besides the messages on the screen you will find a field of mushrooms 
scattered throughout the screen.  There will be no mushrooms on the bottom line.
The players gun will be shown moving randomly about the screen firing at will.
The spider, flea, and scorpion will enter just as it would in the game play.  If
the entire centipede is shot, the screen changes colors and a new centipede
enters.  The player's gun will be destroyed by running into the spider, flea, or
centipede.  Everything is just like the game play except there are no sounds, no
scoring, and no player input.

	When no credit exists neither start button LED will be on.  When credit
exists for a 1 player game the 1 player start LED will flash.  When credit exists
for either a one or two player game then both LED's will flash.  Note that in
"2 CREDIT MINIMUM" mode the 1 player start LED will not flash until two credits
have been entered.

	If the slam switch is closed during attract or play mode
the abuse alarm, a loud irritating sound, will occur.  This will
alert the operator that the game coin door is being abused.

	The top three high scores will be loaded from the EAROM at power up
if there are no checksum errors.
If the option switches for bonus lives, number of starting lives or game
difficulty are changed from the switch settings saved in the EAROM,
the high scores will be discarded (but not the accounting statistics).

		GAME PLAY
		---------

	This mode is entered when one of the two flashing start switches is
pushed.  The appropriate LED will then stay on until the end of the game.  In a
one player game, there will be no score displayed for player 2 in the upper right
corner.  There will be no screen messages except the scores and numbers of lives 
remaining shown on the top row of the screen.  In a two player game the message
"PLAYER x" will appear to indicate which player is up.

	The player's gun will appear in the center of the bottom row.  His controls
are now active and can be used to move his gun left, right, up, or down.  You
will note that the player's upward motion is restricted to the bottom few rows.
The player's fire button can be fired in single fire mode or rapid fire mode.  As
long as the fire switch is depressed, a shot will be fired whenever it is available.

	The centipede enters from the top and snakes its way down the screen.  It
turns whenever it collides with an object.  When it is shot it will break into
two smaller centipedes.  When the centipedes reach the bottom they will start
back up always staying in the area used by the player.  When a large centipede
starts back up it releases its tail segment as a new head.  If all the centipede
is not destroyed once it has reached the bottom, new heads will start out from
the sides near the bottom.  The heads will come out more often as time progresses.
When the entire centipede is destroyed the screen will change colors and a new
centipede will enter from the top.  The new centipede will have one less segment
but there will be a fast head.  The second wave has a slow centipede, the third
a fast centipede, the forth a slow centipede with two fast heads,etc.  When the
players score reaches 40,000 there will be no more slow centipedes and each wave
brings in more separate heads.  After the wave with all heads, the cycle starts
over with one large centipede.  A centipede segment will destroy the player.

	There is also a spider which enters from one side and proceeds towards
the other side moving in a random pattern.  He can destroy the player as well as
eliminating any mushrooms he moves over.  The value of the spider depends on
how close he is to the player.  The first few spiders are slow.  Starting at 60,000
points the spider will restrict his travel closer to the bottom of the screen.

	Starting with the second wave, the flea will bombard the player randomly
depositing mushrooms behind him.  The flea comes out whenever the number of mush-
rooms on the bottom of the screen is less than five.  It takes two hits to destroy
the flea.  The first hit just speeds him up.  The flea does not come out during
the first wave.  After the player reaches 60,000 points the flea will start out
faster.  At 20,000 points the flea will come out if there are fewer than nine mush-
rooms on the bottom of the screen.  At 120,000 points the ant will come out more
often.  The number of mushrooms necessary to bring him out increases with the
score.

	The scorpion enters randomly from either side starting with the forth
wave.  It can move slow or faster but as the game progresses it enters only fast.
The scorpion will turn normal mushrooms into "poisoned" mushrooms.  These mush-
rooms cause any centipedes which run into them to head toward the bottom of the
screen.  This motion can be stopped by shooting the head of this "poisoned"
centitpede.


			HIGH SCORE TABLE
			----------------

	When the player gets one of eight best scores the messages "GREAT SCORE"
and "ENTER YOUR INITIALS" will appear in the middle of the screen.  The player
has a minute and a half to enter his first initial and a minute for each additional
initial otherwise the game will return to the attract mode.  The player can enter
three letters including blanks by using the trackball or joystick and the fire
button.  When the last initial has been entered the game will return to the attract
mode.

	Pushing a flashing start button will cause the game to start without the
player completing his initials.


			SELF TEST
			---------

RAM TEST

	Self test is broken into several smaller tests.  The first test which
must succeed before it will continue is the RAM test.  The zero/stack page and
screen RAM are tested and if an error occurs a number of beeps will be given
indicating the failing chip.  To restart the test reset must be used.  This test
stops at the first RAM failure detected.

# of Beeps	PCB Position		Address			RAM Type
----------	------------		-------			--------

    1		    H2		(0-3FF LSB)			  2114
    2		    F2		(0-3FF MSB)			  2114
    3		    K7		(400-40F,440-44F,etc. LSB)	  2101
    4		    K5		(400-40F,440-44F,etc. MSB)	  2101
    5		    L7		(410-41F,450-455,etc. LSB)	  2101
    6		    L5		(410-41F,450-455,etc. MSB)	  2101
    7		    M7		(420-42F,460-46F,etc. LSB)	  2101
    8		    M5		(420-42F,460-46F,etc. MSB)	  2101
    9		    N7		(430-43F,470-47F,etc. LSB)	  2101
   10		    N5		(430-43F,470-47F,etc. MSB)	  2101



ROM TEST

	If the RAM test succeeds the next step will be checksumming the ROM's.
The ROM's will be checksummed in 2048 byte blocks.  If an error occurs the
difference will be displayed in the upper left corner next to a number corresponding
to the chart below:

ROM Number	PCB Position		ROM Address		EPROM or ROM Type
----------	------------		-----------		-----------------

    0		    D1			 2000-27FF		   2716 or 8316
    1		    E1			 2800-2FFF		   2716 or 8316
    2		    F/H1		 3000-37FF		   2716 or 8316
    3		    J1			 3800-3FFF		   2716 or 8316
    4               E5                   N/A                       ER2055
    5               B/C/D3               N/A                       POKEY

	There is also a S4264 (8K by 8) ROM which can replace the four 2716's.
If this chip fails then any one of the four checksums will be displayed showing
the portion in error.

	Note that the hexidecimal number following the ROM number corresponds to
data lines as follows:

	80	D7	These numbers can be combined
	40	D6	to indicate multiple bit
	20	D5	problems.  Hence "C5" means
	10	D4	D7, D6, D2 and D0 were wrong.
	 8	D3
	 4	D2
	 2	D1
	 1	D0


SCREEN LAYOUT

	The screen will initially set for a tan background with the entire
character set displayed in the right most six columns.  You will notice that
the second pair of columns flips the pictures vertically.  The third pair should
flip the pictures horizontally.  In the middle of the screen you will see sixteen
motion objects offset by one horizontally and vertically.

	All inputs are displayed in six columns on the left side of the screen.
The top row is D0, the next row D1, etc., with the last row being D7.  Each column
will be discussed more fully in the sections below.


LED TEST

	The two start LEDS should be on throughout self test.


OPTION SWITCH TEST

	The first column on the left corresponds to bank 1 of the option switches.
The second column corresponds to bank 2.  All option switches settings can be
selected by looking at attract except the number of lives, the coin mech multi-
pliers, the game difficulty and the bonus coin selection.  In self test you will
will find the information needed to set these four exceptions.  In the middle of
the screen you will see a number of players guns corresponding to the number
the player will start with.  Below this are three digits giving the coin mech
multipliers for the left, middle and right coin mechs respectively.  Below this
there may be two digits giving the bonus adder selection.  If there are no digits
then no bonus coins are selected.  To understand these two digits, say 5 and 2,
you should read it as 5 coins gives 2 bonus coins.  The last line will have a
message "EASY" or "HARD" for the game difficulty.


TRACKBALL/JOYSTICK TEST

	Self test starts out with player 1 trackball or joystick enabled.  The
switch inputs for the trackball in the forth and fifth columns for the horizontal
and vertical respectively.  D7 is the direction bit and should remain constant
while the trackball is being rolled in the same direction.  D0 through D3 are the
four bits of the up/down counter.  You should see these bits count up/down if the
trackball is moved slowly.

	For joystick input see the last column of the switch inputs.  D7, D6, D5,
D4 for player 1 and D3, D2, D1 and D0 for player 2 are the up, down, left, and
right directions respectively.

	The trackball or joystick move one motion object on the screen.  
Verify that the motion object moves in the direction directed by the joystick or
trackball.

	Pushing the player 2 fire switch causes the second trackball and joystick
inputs to be used.  Pushing the player 1 fire switch returns control to player 1
controlls.


SWITCH TEST

	All the switches shown in the third column (2 start buttons, 2 fire
switches, slam switch, 3 coin switches) cause an audio beep when they are 
depressed.  If more switches are depressed, then the volume increases and a lower
frequency is used.  If self test comes up with the sound on, a switch is 
shorted and can be found by checking for a zero in the third column of switch
inputs or depressing switches until no sound change is detected.  If no sounds
are detected, check the volume pot or check the POKEY chip.


POKEY TEST

	The POKEY chip is used for random numbers and sound generation.
The switch tests above test the basic sound generation capability
(i.e. volume and frequency).  Whenever the 1 player start switch
is pushed the next POKEY channel will be used.  The channels will
advance from one to two to three to zero and back to one.  Hence by
pushing this button four times it is possible to determine if one
POKEY channel is not functioning.


COLOR RAM TEST

	Pushing the 1 player start causes the background color to change from
color zero (tan) to one (light green) to two (pink), etc., up to fifteen (black)
and back to zero.  Pushing the 2 player start changes the playfield and motion
object colors (three color ram locations each).  Again this button just cycles
through all the colors.


MOTION OBJECT TEST

	Movement of the motion objects can be tested by moving the trackball or
joystick as was mentioned earlier.  Pushing the 1 player start button causes the
current motion object number to be incremented.  This means another motion object
can be moved via the trackball or joystick.  The motion object pictures can be
tested by pushing the player 1 fire button.  After pushing the fire button sixty-
four times the pictures will return to their original code except they are reflected
vertically.  After another sixty-four they will be reflected horizontally.  This
acts the same as the playfield stamps.


EAROM TEST

	The EAROM will be read into a RAM buffer.  If the checksum does not match,
the difference will be displayed below the other ROM checksums.  If the EAROM
data is good, no checksum will occur and there will be two messages in the center
of the screen.  The first message is the total number of plays since the last
time the EAROM was cleared.  The second is the average game time accurate to four
seconds.

	The EAROM will be cleared by pushing the
1 player start, 2 player start and the player 1 fire switch simultaneously.
When the EAROM is cleared the checksum in the upper left corner will show "FF".
This clears both the high scores and the accounting info.  Note that the EAROM
will be initialized automatically with the completion of a game. 


			COLOR MONITOR ALIGNMENT
			------------------------


	The first adjustment is sizing and centering the picture.  This can be
done in either self test or in attract mode.  Try to fill in as much of the 
screen as possible by adjusting the horizontal and vertical width.  Be sure that
picture is centered and that both left and margins are visible by observing the
two six digit player scores at the top row.  Also be sure that the copyright
message is clearly visible on the bottom line in attract.

	To adjust the monitor color set the slam switch on and enter self test.
A color bar pattern should appear showing all sixteen colors used.  The colors are:

	TAN		ORANGE		WHITE		YELLOW
	LIGHT GREEN	DARK GREEN	CYAN		GREEN
	PINK		RED		PURPLE		RED
	DARK BLUE	BLACK		BLUE		BLACK

	To align all three color guns just hit one of the three coin switches
when running in the color bar test.  This will now enter a test pattern with
white dots on a black background.


			PCB TEST PROCEDURE
			------------------

 1)  Turn on self test and push reset.
 2)  Did the RAM test pass?  If not replace failing chip and restart test.
 3)  Is there a TV picture?  If not check video circuitry.  Is watchdog causing
     the game to be reset over and over?  If so, the processor circuitry
     is not working.
 4)  Are both LED's on?  If not, LED's are burned out or there is an error in
     the LED driving circuits.
 5)  There should be no checksums shown in the upper left hand corner.  If there
     are then correct the EPROM or ROM in error. Note that ROM 4 can have a
     checksum error if it has never been used or if it has been cleared (check-
     sum=FF).
 6)  Test both banks of option switches to be sure they can be turned on (0) as
     well as off (1).
 7)  Test player one trackball or joystick.  The motion object should move in
     the correct direction.  Also check that the motion object does not jump
     more than one vertical or horizontal position.
 8)  Push all switches (2 start buttons, 3 coin switches, 1 slam switch, 2 fire
     buttons).  If no sounds occur check the volume or the POKEY circuitry.  If
     one switch does not cause a sound then check that switch input on the screen.
     If switches are shorted together you should hear the tone difference as well
     as see it on the screen.
 9)  Push the player 2 fire button and check the player 2 trackball or joystick
     as you did for player 1.
10)  If the POKEY polycounter circuitry is not functioning ROM 5 will appear
     in the upper left corner.
11)  Test the POKEY volume control by pushing up to four switches down at once
     and noting the increase in volume.
12)  Test all four POKEY channels by pushing the 1 player start four times and
     noting that the sounds are all the same.
13)  Check the motion object pictures by pushing the player 1 fire button.
14)  Check the motion object circuitry by using the trackball and using the player
     1 start button to advance to the next motion object.
15)  Check the playfield stamps and their color by checking the right most six
     columns on the screen.
16)  Push the slam switch and then the reset button.  This should enter the play-
     field color RAM test.  Are all the colors as they should be?
17)  Push a coin switch.  The screen should be a pattern of white dots on black
     background.
18)  Turn off self test.  The game should now go into attract.
19)  To check the EAROM start a game and die as quickly as possible.  Wait 8
     seconds and then enter self test.  There should be no checksum error and the
     accounting information should appear in the center of the screen.
